# Holberton School
### The place for C and Python

Above is all of the material that was covered at Holberton school. The goal for this material being on github was to both check our work over the course, and display the material that we went over. Orignally each of the folders here were there own repo, but to clear up my repo list and make it organized they were removed and added back here in this Repo dedicated to there material.

Originally the code in this repository will be a little messy, but with commits and over time the best practices I have picked up from then till now will be displayed as I clean up once written code and create much better documentation.

## holberton-system_engineering-devops
This Repository was dedicated to material based around concepts important to System devops work. Here we will see most of the Shell code, as well as networking and firewall related concepts and configurations.

## holbertonschool-higher_level_programming
This Repository was dedicated almost entirely to python, however some javascript is sprikled in towards the end. This was not the First programming langauge the school had showed us, so this is more oriented in learning the differences between C and python, and what makes python the powerful langauge that it is.

## holbertonschool-lower_level_programming
This Repository was dedicated to learning C, it was my first real langauge I learned. In here we cover a large amount of concepts, to not just understand the code we are writing but the process in which the computer is taking to do the tasks we ask of it.

## holbertonschool-zero_day
This Repository was dedicated to learning how to we would interact with github and our C code.
